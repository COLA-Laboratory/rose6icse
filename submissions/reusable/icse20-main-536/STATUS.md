# Apply for the Reusable and Available Badges

We are applying for the Reusable and Available badges for the following reasons:
- We have made our prototype tool available by placing it in a publicly accessible repository on Github.
- We have carefully documented and structured it to the extent that reuse and repurposing are facilitated. 
- We have provided code to apply our tool to 8 different models on six different datasets.
- We have made it very easy to reproduce our results in paper by just running three python commands.
