[Reusable]

We release part of the execution logs during our large scale experiment and all the generated patches.

All the data is placed on a publicly accessible GitHub repository as well [https://github.com/APRStudy/APRStudy.git].

We explain how the data is collected and how to reuse it in detail. For more information, please read [README.md].
